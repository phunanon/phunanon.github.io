        <h2>"Sondex Kernel" - MQTT broker</h2>
        <p>
          The vision of the software management at the start of my role was to
          reign-in decades' worth of utilities and software suites to one
          communication protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was decided to use one akin to MQTT, which would be translated to
          an embed-suitable protocol on-the-fly. I helped architect and test
          this new platform with their senior engineer. It became the "Sondex
          Ultracom" platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          After development, to begin developing a new Ultracom
          utility&mdash;however small&mdash;required including up to fifteen
          .NET libraries. It was required to use ever-evolving boilerplate to
          operate them. I couldn't tolerate this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was granted the time to investigate solving this issue, and
          architected what I called the "Kernel." It became the sole dependency
          on a project, and at runtime would use reflection to orchestrate one
          communication "daemon" and one or more "modules". The Kernel provided
          a thin abstraction between the two types of actor, and completely
          divorced our business logic from our communication logic for any
          project. It also made "modules" composable between each other, using
          MQTT. It sincerely was my favourite programming project of all time.

            <p>
              As an experiment I developed a C# web-server with an Ultracom MQTT
              backend, allowing you to remotely monitor and control devices over
              the internet.

              of oil wells. Here the calipers were depressed by hand on one
              side.

              I was made to learn MVP at work&mdash;something I thought wouldn't

            </p>
            <p>
              Older coworkers managed to avoid good practise, resulting in very
              tightly-coupled, difficult to maintain programs. In an effort to
              combat this I wrote a document on how&mdash;and why&mdash;to use
              the Model-View-Presenter pattern in WinForms projects.

          voters in ranges, schedule ballots, and make use of 3 different

              I'd written a simple O(n^2) engine while bored, in SFML, but that
              wasn't challenging enough! I shoehorned it onto an ATtiny85, but
              it's 60x slower than the video...
            </p>

              The display also isn't perfect for it, as it eats 8-bit vertical
              stripes at a time.

          Using an Atmel ATtiny85 with Arduino IDE, I constructed an inexpensive
          hit-detection device for the sport Fencing, &Eacute;p&eacute;e
