      <h2>Personal Experience</h2>
      <p>
        As an avid hobbyist, private tutor, and freelance developer, I have
        touched upon many technologies out of interest or necessity. I do
        sincerely welcome visits to
        <a href="https://phunanon.github.io">my portfolio</a> listing most of my
        notable projects.
      </p>
      <h3>Flagship project &ndash; Insitux scripting language</h3>
      <p>
        I have enjoyed programming language design for several years, but only
        Insitux has gained traction. Originally commissioned for a mildly
        popular Roblox game it is quite extensible, written in TypeScript, using
        TDD methodology, mainly targetting NodeJS and the web. I have written
        extensive documentation, recorded tutorials, and fostered a community of
        over 300 members.

          Tutoring has been an elastic second job for me (0 to 16 hours per
          week) since 2018, with over 600 hours of in person and online 1-to-1
          classes logged. I help students of all ages with their assignments,
          theses, and homework, from technical minutiae to academic
          comprehension.

          I develop and maintain crypto-market analysis software for a client
          invested in cryptocurrency. I am personally disinterested in
          cryptocurrency trade, but I work with my client to implement the
          visualisations and data analysis he requires. Most of the software is
          hosted on Digital Ocean behind a OTP secure proxy, or OTA updated
          client-side scripts.
