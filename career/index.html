            All my professional roles have been primarily .NET / C#, from
            industrial to web, from WinForms to REST APIs, learning how to
            develop for high performance and throughput, and how to architect
            for maintainability and testability. I have used it since 2013 but
            rarely for hobby work.
          </p>
          <p>
            My use of C# matured when I joined Mi-Voice, because my previous two
            roles had 0% unit test coverage. Now I enjoy 100% test coverage,
            right down to counting the number of times a method is called with
            exact parameters. It made me realise why my previous role was so
            frustrating, because we would just arbitrarily pick up whatever
            architectures Microsoft suggested, and a lack of unit tests meant we
            didn't benefit nor implement them correctly! And of course the
            endless regressions; they eventually hired QA which was super
            helpful but probably redundant if we were given the time to test.

            I adore TypeScript and its ecosystem - undoubtedly my favourite
            programming language. I'm a huge advocate of it over using
            JavaScript directly and employ TS in the majority of my personal
            projects, as well as every day at work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm even mad enough that I love using TS as a backend, as I often
            have for Discord bots and what's essentially systems programming in
            <a href="https://screeps.com">Screeps</a>. Haven't been able to use
            TS as a backend technology at work yet though.

            I have become all too familiar with JavaScript in my life - I
            practically grew up with it. JS was the only programming language I
            was able to use at school so I ended up learning it in the library
            every lunchtime&ndash;fun times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Professionally I got to start using JS in my GE role for demos, my
            second role involved mostly JQuery, and my third role extensively
            used TypeScript.

            I have been using C++ on-and-off ever since first exposure. I turn
            to it for any high-performance work. I enjoy using it in constrained
            environments such as Arduino, designing programming languages and
            operating systems, and I have made few simple games in the past too.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was once offered a job in C++, which gives me confidence every
            time I return to the language and I've inevitably become rusty.

          <p>
            Don't think of React as an innocent web technology - it is a beast.
            That said, take the right approaches, with TypeScript, and you'll
            end up with sprawling yet maintainable web apps. Trying to go back
            to imperative style JavaScript after becoming familiar with React is
            painful.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I haven't used React outside of work - I think none of my
            web hobby projects are ever big enough to warrant it, and for my one
            reactive hobby project I used SolidJS instead.

          <p>
            At university I disliked learning about SQL, and yet it was one of
            the only things I walked away from campus having learned. In the
            beginning I thought it was useless when I could just process data
            directly in my application code - an infantile notion. My
            appreciation for relational databases grew as I began tutoring my
            students about it - basically learning it over and over, so that all
            that stuff about normalisation and such really hammers in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I use SQLite in a lot of my personal projects, and have worked
            professionally with Microsoft SQL Server since 2020.

          <h2>Clojure</h2>
          <pills>
            <pill>Used 2019&ndash;2022</pill>
          </pills>
          <p>
            I was once a happy Clojure (and ClojureScript) user - it was how I
            learned functional programming, and ever since learning it all my
            homegrown programming languages (e.g.
            <a href="https://phunanon.github.io/Chika/">Chika</a>,
            <a href="https://insitux.github.io/">Insitux</a>) have been heavily
            inspired by it. Clojure freed me from rigid OOP and static typing,
            and I even did my dissertation in it, and a few major hobby projects
            at the time. It's an impressive language and I still recommend every
            programmer tries it out - a mental exercise you'd struggle to find
            elsewhere. I didn't even use it like a LISP - I probably only wrote
            one macro in my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I stopped using it because something made static typing sexy again:
            TypeScript. However, I still yearn for its solid and performant
            immutable data structures, its terse code, its philosophy, and I
            wish I could have used it professionally because I'm sure there's
            plenty of features and approaches I'm unaware of that could rival
            TypeScript. I also wish I could have used Datomic, because it seems
            really cool.

          <h2>"Sondex Kernel" - MQTT broker</h2>
          <p>
            The vision of the software management at the start of my role was to
            rein-in decades' worth of utilities and software suites to one
            communication protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was decided to use one akin to MQTT, which would be translated to
            an embed-suitable protocol on-the-fly. I helped architect and test
            this new platform with their senior engineer. It became the "Sondex
            Ultracom" platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            After development, to begin developing a new Ultracom
            utility&mdash;however small&mdash;required including up to fifteen
            .NET libraries. It was required to use ever-evolving boilerplate to
            operate them. I couldn't tolerate this.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was granted the time to investigate solving this issue, and
            architected what I called the "Kernel." It became the sole
            dependency on a project, and at runtime would use reflection to
            orchestrate one communication "daemon" and one or more "modules".
            The Kernel provided a thin abstraction between the two types of
            actor, and completely divorced our business logic from our
            communication logic for any project. It also made "modules"
            composable between each other, using MQTT. It sincerely was my
            favourite programming project of all time.
